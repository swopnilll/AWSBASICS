# AWS Foundational Course Overview

## Objective

Provide foundational knowledge about AWS and its benefits for businesses.

## AWS Services Range

- **Basic services:** Compute, storage, network security tools.
- **Complex solutions:** Blockchain, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robot development platforms.
- **Specialised toolsets:** Video production management systems, orbital satellites rentable by the minute.

## Key Concepts

### Client-Server Model

Real-world metaphor using a coffee shop:

- **Morgan** as the server (barista), representing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
- **Blaine** as the client (customer), making requests and receiving responses.

### Simple Transactions

Example:

- Customer requests coffee.
- Barista validates the request (payment) and responds with the coffee (service).

### AWS Pay-Per-Use Principle

- **Analogy:** Coffee shop employees are paid only for hours worked.
- **On-Premises Data Centers:** Pre-paid resources with capacity constraints.
- **AWS Model:** No pre-payment, scalable capacity on demand.

## Benefits of AWS

### Scalability

Easily increase or decrease resources (instances) as needed, similar to staffing a coffee shop based on demand.

### Cost Efficiency

Pay only for what you use, avoiding unnecessary expenses for unused capacity.

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### On-Demand Delivery

- AWS provides the resources you need, when you need them.
- Instantly launch or terminate resources as required.

### IT Resources

- AWS offers a wide range of IT elements needed by businesses.
- Focus on what differentiates your business, while AWS handles the common tasks.

### Access Over the Internet

- Access resources securely via a web console or programmatically.
- No additional contracts or sales calls needed.

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

- Only pay for the resources you use.
- Avoid unnecessary expenses, similar to staffing a coffee shop based on peak hours.

## Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

### Cloud-Based Deployment

- Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications or design and build new applications in the cloud.
- Examples include virtual servers, databases, and networking components fully based in the cloud.

### On-Premises Deployment

- Also known as private cloud deployment.
- Deploy resources using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increases resource utilization with application management and virtualization technologies.

### Hybrid Deployment

- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.
- Suitable for maintaining legacy applications on-premises while using cloud services for new capabilities.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### Trade Upfront Expenses for Variable Expense

- Pay only for the computing resources you consume.
- Implement innovative solutions while saving on costs.

### Stop Spending Money to Run and Maintain Data Centers

- Focus more on applications and customers rather than managing infrastructure.

### Stop Guessing Capacity

- Scale resources in response to demand.
- Avoid paying for unused resources or dealing with limited capacity.

### Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale

- Lower variable costs due to the aggregation of usage from many customers.
- AWS achieves higher economies of scale, translating into lower pay-as-you-go prices.

### Increase Speed and Agility

- Develop and deploy applications more quickly.
- Access new resources within minutes, enabling more time for experimentation and innovation.

### Go Global in Minutes

- Deploy applications to customers around the world quickly.
- Provide low latency access to your applications, regardless of customer location.
- Explore AWS global infrastructure and services to deliver content worldwide.
