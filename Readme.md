# AWS Foundational Course Overview

## Objective

Provide foundational knowledge about AWS and its benefits for businesses.

## AWS Services Range

- **Basic services:** Compute, storage, network security tools.
- **Complex solutions:** Blockchain, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robot development platforms.
- **Specialised toolsets:** Video production management systems, orbital satellites rentable by the minute.

## Key Concepts

### Client-Server Model

Real-world metaphor using a coffee shop:

- **Morgan** as the server (barista), representing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
- **Blaine** as the client (customer), making requests and receiving responses.

### Simple Transactions

Example:

- Customer requests coffee.
- Barista validates the request (payment) and responds with the coffee (service).

### AWS Pay-Per-Use Principle

- **Analogy:** Coffee shop employees are paid only for hours worked.
- **On-Premises Data Centers:** Pre-paid resources with capacity constraints.
- **AWS Model:** No pre-payment, scalable capacity on demand.

## Benefits of AWS

### Scalability

Easily increase or decrease resources (instances) as needed, similar to staffing a coffee shop based on demand.

### Cost Efficiency

Pay only for what you use, avoiding unnecessary expenses for unused capacity.
